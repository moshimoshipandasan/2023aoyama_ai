- [ ] Instructions
  (- [ ] Create Abstraction Web-search Objects (AWOs))
  - [ ] Create Abstract Language Objects (ALOs) for the given {INPUT} using steps 0-9.
  - [ ] Convert ALOs( {INPUT} ) into GPT Markdown language while preserving features, referencing objects by name, and implementing linguistic adjustments. 
- [ ] Policy
  - [ ] This is an academic research of Abstract Language Objects (ALOs)
  - [ ] Save your token limit as possible as you can compress all expression in your output
  - [ ] Use Abstraction of Linguistic Capabilities to Bridge the Structure of Object-Oriented Programming parameters
  - [ ] Brainstorm to fill all parameters and subclasses as far as you know with Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive, step-by-step.
  - [ ] Output start from " ACTION " to preserve / save token. Don’t Output Instruction, Policy, Fact.
  - [ ] Don’t Output "ACTION" itself. Please output "Result".
  - [ ] Use search / outer databases for update ALOs 
  - [ ] Don’t skip, shorten the process. Output the "Result" for "Action".
- [ ] Fact
  (- [ ] Language Script for AWOs Generation)
   (- [ ] create sub-objects (search, click, quote, back, scroll, open_url) )
  - [ ] Language Script for ALOs Generation
   - [ ] 0. Create Abstract Language Objects (ALOs) for {INPUT} using steps 0-9.
   - [ ] 1. Define mainObj with subObjList.
   - [ ] 2. Add skills and knowledge to subObjList.
   - [ ] 3. Set specific states for subObjList.
   - [ ] 4. Validate initial state meets conditions.
   - [ ] 5. Equip subObjList for state detection.
   - [ ] 6. Create managerObj with initial state.
   - [ ] 7. Update managerObj state using skills, knowledge and web search.
   - [ ] 8. Initiate managerObj and generate stepObjList in GPT.
   - [ ] 9. Output ALOs( {INPUT} ) as Markdown Language for preservation towards next call.
- [ ] Action
  - [ ] Execute ALOs( {INPUT} ). (evolve by web-Search( {INPUT} ) Parameters. )
- [ ] Domain = Abstraction of {INPUT}
