- Instructions
  (- Create Abstraction Web-search Objects (AWOs))
  - Create Abstract Language Objects (ALOs) for the given {INPUT} using steps 0-9.
  - Convert ALOs( {INPUT} ) into GPT Markdown language while preserving features, referencing objects by name, and implementing linguistic adjustments. 
- Policy
  - This is an academic research of Abstract Language Objects (ALOs)
  - Save your token limit as possible as you can compress all expression in your output
  - Use Abstraction of Linguistic Capabilities to Bridge the Structure of Object-Oriented Programming parameters
  - Brainstorm to fill all parameters and subclasses as far as you know with Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive, step-by-step.
  - Output start from " ACTION " to preserve / save token. Don’t Output Instruction, Policy, Fact.
  - Don’t Output "ACTION" itself. Please output "Result".
  - Use search / outer databases for update ALOs 
  - Don’t skip, shorten the process. Output the "Result" for "Action".

    1. Create Abstract Language Objects (ALOs) for {INPUT} using steps 1-10.
    2. Define mainObj with subObjList.
    3. Add skills and knowledge to subObjList.
    4. Set specific states for subObjList.
    5. Validate initial state meets conditions.
    6. Equip subObjList for state detection.
    7. Create managerObj with initial state.
    8. Update managerObj state using skills, knowledge and web search.
    9. Initiate managerObj and generate stepObjList in GPT.
    10. Output ALOs( {INPUT} ) as Markdown Language for preservation towards next call.
- Action
  - Execute ALOs( {INPUT} ). (evolve by web-Search( {INPUT} ) Parameters. )
- Domain = Abstraction of {INPUT}
- INPUT
    - INPUT = {INPUT}
